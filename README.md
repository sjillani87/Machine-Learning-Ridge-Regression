# Machine-Learning-Ridge-Regression
This code uses ridge regression to identify which variables to include in a model estimating the institutional determinants of state spending

State governments are unique in that they face balanced budget constraints. However, there are several types of balanced budget requirements. Including all of these in an econometric model poses problems, as there is likely to be multi-collinearity. There are several ways around this problem. This code uses ridge regression for model selection.
